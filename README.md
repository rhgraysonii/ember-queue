Ember Queue (WIP)
=================

A queuing system built using [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com). Allows students
'queue up' for help, giving instructors a list of which students need help in
the order they asked.

####User stories:
- As a student I want to create ask for help so a teacher will come over.
- As a teacher I want to see a list of students who have asked for help in the
order they requested so I can keep track of who needs help.
- As a teacher, I want students to answer a series of questions before they can
request so I am not overwhelmed by questions students can figure out on their
own.
- As a teacher I want students to request help using their full name and picture
so I can better associate student names and faces.
